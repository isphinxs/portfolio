                <AboutP>
                    Throughout my career, I have worked at the intersection of science education, outreach, and program management to make positive change in the world.

                <AboutP>
                    In grad school I was exposed to programming through ArcGIS and have been interested in coding ever since.  I went on to study software engineering at <AboutA href="https://www.freecodecamp.org">FreeCodeCamp</AboutA> and the <AboutA href="https://flatironschool.com/">Flatiron School</AboutA>.

                <AboutP>
                    With experience in environmental studies, publishing, and software engineering, I enjoy shepherding both technical projects and more complex, mission-driven venturesâ€”and developing processes to make those programs more efficient and easier to manage.
